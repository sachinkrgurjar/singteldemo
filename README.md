# singteldemo
This is to demo code implementation as per given use case.
Animal is the mainparent interfac and all classes implements it. 
Bird and fish are classes which implement interface Animal. Other subclasses extends or adds their own methods.
Properties in classes are managed by boolean flag to allow status check on any feature.
Sample test case is implemented using mockito.
Rest api is not added due to time constraint.

Thanks.
